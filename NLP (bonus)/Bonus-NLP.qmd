A comparison of the Federal Reserve's FOMC announcement and the accompanying speech by the Fed Chair reveals notable differences in linguistic composition, particularly in the usage of adjectives, modal verbs, and adverbs.

- The announcement is characterised by a prevalence of adjectives, which account for 8.61% of the total words. The announcement is notable for its relatively high proportion of adjectives, which constitute 8.61% of the total number of words. The most frequently occurring adjectives are "economic," "federal," "FOMC," and "longer." This reflects a focus on institutional references, policy horizons, and economic conditions.
- Modals: The modal verbs (e.g., "will," "should") are used at a rate of 1.29%. The frequent use of the modal verb "will" suggests a forward-looking stance and planned policy actions.
- Adverbs: Adverbs account for 2.19% of the total number of words. Terms such as "further," "however," and "currently" indicate subtle shifts in perspective, qualifications of statements, and temporal framing.

A summary of the speech is provided below:
- Adjectives: Adjectives account for 6.22% of the total number of words, which is a relatively lower proportion than that observed in the announcement. The use of terms such as "federal," "economic," "financial," "appropriate," and "transitory" suggests an emphasis on conditions, policy suitability, and evolving circumstances.
- Modals: The speech employs a greater number of modal verbs (1.41% of total words) than the announcement, with "will," "would," and "could" being the most prevalent. This indicates an increased focus on potential scenarios, policymaker intentions, and conditional outcomes.
- Adverbs: The speech employs a greater number of adverbs than the announcement, with the former containing 3.86% of total words. The use of common adverbs, such as "so," "very," "well," "also," and "carefully," conveys stance, degree, and manner, thereby adding depth to the Chair's explanatory narrative.

In conclusion, the announcement is more adjective-heavy, framing the current economic landscape and policies. In contrast, the speech relies more on modal verbs and adverbs to explore possibilities, clarify intent, and describe the manner in which policies may unfold.
